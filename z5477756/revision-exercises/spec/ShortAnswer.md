l2.add(s);
l1.add(o);
l2.add(o);
c = l1.get(0);

## Question 10

An online camping store, sells different kinds of camping equipment. Items selected by the customer are added to a shopping cart. When a user clicks on the checkout Button, the application is required to calculate the total amount to be paid. The calculation logic for each item type varies, and we want to move all the calculation logic to one separate class, to decouple the different items from the calculation logic applied on them. As the application iterates through the disparate set of items of the shopping cart, we apply the price computation logic in the class to each item type. Which of the following patterns would be useful to design this scenario?

- A) Strategy Pattern
- B) Decorator Pattern
- C) Iterator Pattern
- D) Visitor Patter

## Question 11

For generic types in Java, which of the following is/are correct? Select one or more:

1. `List<Integer>` is a subtype of `List<Number>`.
2. `List<? super Integer>` matches `List<Integer>` and `List<Number>`.
3. The wildcard `<? extends Foo>` matches `Foo` and any subtype of `Foo`, where `Foo` is any type.
4. The wildcard `<? extends Foo>` matches `Foo` and any super type of `Foo`, where `Foo` is any type.

## Question 12

Consider a vending machine application that dispenses products when the proper combination of coins is deposited. Which of the following design patterns is suitable for such a vending machine application?

}

class Y {
    public void b() {}
}

class Z extends X, Y {
    protected void a() {}

    public void b() {}

    public void b(String arg) {}
}
```

Now, consider the following statements about the code:

- (1) The code doesn’t compile because there is more than one class in the same file;
- (2) The code doesn’t compile because double inheritance is not possible in Java;
- (3) The code doesn’t compile because the methods a and b are not marked with @Override
- (4) The code doesn't compile because you cannot overload a method that is overriding a method in a superclass;
- (5) The code doesn’t compile because a cannot have its visibility reduced from the superclass to the subclass.
- (6) The code does compile.

Which of the following sets of statements about the code are true?

- A) (1), (2)
- B) (1), (3), (5)
- C) (2), (3), (4), (5)
- D) (2), (5)

- B) Implementing the equals method for an object
- C) It’s a trick question, you should never use instanceof in your code at all

# Short Answer Practice Questions

> We are not providing sample answers for the following, but if you wish to get clarifications on what we might expect for each of these questions, make a post on the forum :)

## Question 1

1. Identify the logic error present (1 mark); and
2. Write a failing assertion that would catch the logic error as part of a unit test (e.g. `assertEquals(4, f(2))`) (1 mark)

### Part A (2 Marks)

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this == obj) return true;
    if (obj == null) return false;
    if (!(obj instanceof Article)) return false;

    Article other = (Article) obj;

    return this.title.equals(other.title) && this.views.equals(other.views);
}
```

### Part B (2 marks)

```java
public List<Integer> withoutOddNumbers(List<Integer> numbers) {
    for (Integer number : numbers) {
        if (number % 2 != 0) {
            numbers.remove(number);
        }
    }

    return new ArrayList<Integer>(numbers);
}
```

## Question 2 (2 marks)

Consider the `Angle` class versus the `MathsHelper` class from the Blackout assignment, provided in `Angle.java` and `MathsHelper.java`.

Which class do you think has better **cohesion**? Justify your answer

## Question 3

In 22T3 COMP2511 is contemplating moving to Jira for students to manage their projects. There are three different types of Jira boards that can be used: Scrum, Kanban and Bug Tracking. All boards have the same flow of work, and allow for features including support for issue tracking and customisation of project-specific features. However, some elements may vary for each type of board - Scrum boards take two week sprints whereas Kanban has a series of epics that are progressed through, and bug tracking projects only have a single backlog. Once a project is created as Scrum, Kanban or Bug Tracking it cannot change its type.

Which Design Pattern could be used to model this? In answering, justify your choice by describing how the above scenario relates to the **key characteristics** of your chosen Design Pattern.

## Question 4 (10 marks)

Consider the following Java code:

```java
class Foo {
    public ArrayList<String> bar() {
        return new ArrayList<String>();
    }
}

class Foo2 extends Foo {
    @Override
    public List<String> bar() {
        return new ArrayList<String>();
    }
}
```

The code currently does not compile and has the following error message (on `List<String> bar` in `Foo2`):

> The return type is incompatible with `Foo.bar()`

- a) Explain the difference between **covariance** and **contravariance**. (2 marks)
- b) Does the above code fail to compile because it breaks **covariance** or **contravariance**? (1 mark)
- c) With reference to Design by Contract, explain how the above code constitutes invalid inheritance and **violates the Liskov Substitution Principle**. (4 marks)
- d) The above error is a compile-time error. Many errors due to LSP we have studied are logic errors. Explain why the above compilation error is more desirable than allowing the code to compile, with reference to concepts surrounding **risk engineering**. (3 marks)

## Question 5 (3 marks)

Carl, Amanda and Alvin are working on the Assignment II codebase to add some new features for 23T3. They come across a note from the previous engineering team:

> We were trying to make the way Logical Switches are implemented more extensible through refactoring in a few different classes. However, we found that when we tried to make these changes, the Conductor class would always break.

State what design smell is present in the above description, and explain how the smell present is different from Shotgun Surgery.

## Question 6 (5 marks)

Consider the following student's Assignment I code:

```java
for (Entity entity2 : entList) {
    if (entity.canCommunicate(entity2)) {
        if (entity2 instanceof RelaySatellite) {
            for (Entity entity3 : entList) {
                if (entity instanceof StandardSatellite && !(entity3 instanceof DesktopDevice)) {
                    if (entity2.canCommunicate(entity3)) {
                        canCommunicate.add(entity3.getId());
                    }
                } else if (!(entity instanceof StandardSatellite) && entity2.canCommunicate(entity3)) {
                    canCommunicate.add(entity3.getId());
                }
            }
        }
        canCommunicate.add(entity2.getId());
    }
}
```

- a) State two code smells present in the above code. (2 marks)
- b) In your own words, explain what you think is the underlying design problem causing this code smell and what should be done to improve the design. (3 marks)

## Question 7 (4 marks)

You’ve been asked to develop a web-based system for selling tickets to Taylor Swift’s 2025 concert tour. Because of the prevalence of “Swifties” (fans of Taylor Swift), as soon as tickets are made available the system will be immediately flooded with people booking tickets. This may result in tickets being sold that don’t exist, corrupting data and/or causing other logic errors.

With reference to multithreading, how would you design your web server to avoid this issue?

## Question 8 (5 marks)

Large companies with many projects need a way to allow people to keep track of multiple projects at the same time. A system called “Team Central” allows a project manager to create a ticket for their project. They can then add a series of stakeholders to the ticket who are interested in how the project is progressing.

Every week, the project manager posts an update on the Team Central ticket with information about how the project is progressing, and whether it is On Track, Off Track, At Risk or Complete. The stakeholders are notified via email when this update is posted. It its possible for new stakeholders to be added to the list, and for stakeholders to be removed from the list while the project is ongoing.

What Design Pattern could be used to model this? In answering, justify your choice by describing how the above scenario relates to the key characteristics of your chosen Design Pattern.

## Question 9 (4 marks)

With reference to Design by Contract and the Liskov Substitution Principle, explain whether or not the following inheritance relationship is valid. Justify your answer.

```java
class StandardUNSWLatePenalty {
    /**
     * @postconditions: The late penalty will be at most
     * the number of days late * 5
     */
    public int calculateLatePenalty(LocalDateTime dueDate, LocalDateTime submittedDate) {
        // ...
    }
}

class COMP2511AssignmentIILatePenalty extends StandardUNSWLatePenalty {
    /**
     * @postconditions: The late penalty is the number of days late * 2
     */
    public int calculateLatePenalty(LocalDateTime dueDate, LocalDateTime submittedDate) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Question 10 (5 marks)

Suppose that Assignment II contained an additional component, Task 4.

In this task, students had to adapt to another evolution in the requirements that introduced the concept of “power ups”.

At any tick in the game, there is a random chance of the player being given a potion in their inventory which they can consume at any time and will regenerate their health instantly. This probability is specified in the configuration file.

Tina and her group have the following design to test this functionality:

> We are going to write a test that loads the player into the dungeon, and then runs for 1000 ticks of the game. If the power up potion hasn’t been added into the player’s inventory after 1000 ticks, then the test will fail.

What are the issues with this approach to test design? What techniques could Tina and her team use to ensure a more robust test?
